# X-CASH Delegated Proof Of Privacy Stake (DPOPS)

‚ö† Alpha: The DPOPS integration is still a work in progress üèó 
 
X-CASH DPOPS is a variation of DPOS and DBFT that uses verifiable random functions for the selection of the next block producer. The key features of X-CASH DPOPS are:
 
* The top 100 delegates are elected as block verifiers.
* Reserve proof based voting/staking system, meaning the XCASH always stays in your wallet.
* No need to keep your wallet or computer online if your just staking towards a shared delegate.
* No need to keep your XCASH directly on the server if running a solo node, as you can use an empty wallet on the server and vote for yourself.
* A minimum of 2 million XCASH is needed to vote for a delegate.
* A minimum of 20 million XCASH is needed to register as a delegate and not be auto removed for inactivity at UTC 00:00.
 
* The election process is every block, meaning a new vote will get counted for the next block.
* No need to cancel a vote, as it will automatically get cancelled if you change your vote to a different delegate.
* No lockup times, the xcash always remains in your wallet and you can use them at any time, although moving them from your wallet will cancel your entire staking vote.
* No fees for voting, and you can revote or switch your vote as many times as you like.
 
* Using a variation of Delegated Byzantine Fault tolerance consensus where 67% consensus must be reached for a new block to be added to the network.
* DBFT allows for up to 33% of the elected block verifiers to stop working, and the system will still be able to produce a new block.
* Using Verifiable Random Functions to select the next block producer in the system. This allows for a random, but verifiable way of selecting the next block producer.
* Blocks can be verified in the XCASH Daemon with a detailed explanation of the reserve bytes in the block.
 
* Using a decentralized database system, to hold all of the voting data and reserve bytes data.
* The block format is to only store a hash of the contents of the reserve bytes data in the block, and store the actual reserve bytes data in the decentralized database, to reduce the extra size of the blockchain, while keeping all of the rounds data.
 
This program allows one to run a DPOPS node, a shared delegates website, and a delegates website.

**If you plan on running a [shared delegates website](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_DPOPS_shared_delegates_website) or a [delegates website](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_DPOPS_delegates_website), you will need to run the website on the same system as the DPOPS node**

**By running a DPOPS node (solo or shared) you will need the computer to be online and running at all times**

## Recommendations For the XCASH Wallet
It is recommended if you are going to run a XCASH DPOPS node, to not keep all of your XCASH on the server. The recommended way is to create an empty wallet and leave that on the server, to collect the block rewards, and then use your main wallet to vote for the new wallet that you created on the server.



## XCASH_DPOPS Parameters
```
Parameters
--parameters - Show a list of all valid parameters
All parameters are optional, execept for --block_verifiers_secret_key. **The --block_verifiers_secret_key must be the first parameter**

--test - Run the test to make sure the program is compatible with your system

--block_verifiers_secret_key - The block verifiers secret key. This must be the first parameter

--log_file "log_file" - Write all output to a log file with no colors

--log_file_color "log_file" - Write all output to a log file with colors

--total_threads "total_threads" - The total threads to use, the maximum is 100 total threads.
If this parameter is not specified, the default is the number of threads the CPU has.

--XCASH_DPOPS_delegates_IP_address \"delegates IP address\" - The delegates IP address (IPV4 only) to create the server on.
If this parameter is not specified, the default is 0.0.0.0 (all available networking interfaces).

--xcash_wallet_port \"xcash_wallet_port\" - The xcash wallet port.
If this parameter is not specified, the default port is 18285.

--database_name - The name of the database.
If this parameter is not specified, the default name is XCASH_PROOF_OF_STAKE.

--shared_delegates_database_name - The name of the shared delegates database.
If this parameter is not specified, the default name is XCASH_PROOF_OF_STAKE_DELEGATES.

--delegates_website - Run the delegates website

--shared_delegates_website --fee "fee" --minimum_amount "minimum_amount" - Run the shared delegates website, with a fee of "fee" and a minimum amount of "minimum_amount"
The fee in a percentage (1 would equal 1 percent. You can use up to 6 decimal places.)
The minimum for a public_address to receive a payment (10000 etc. The minimum amount should be in regular units, not atomic units.)
The voter inactivity count is optional. This is the number of consecutive days where a voter would have registered in the database, but is not actively participating towards the shared delegate. If this number of consecutive days is reached, the voter will be removed from the database and all funds that were left over would not sent out, since they were below the MINIMUM AMOUNT. If this parameter is not specified, the default amount is 30 consecutive days.
The shared delegate payment time hour is optional. This is the hour that the shared delegate will send the daily payments. If this parameter is not specified, the default amount is a random hour
The shared delegate payment time minute is optional. This is the minute that the shared delegate will send the daily payments. If this parameter is not specified, the default amount is a random minute.

--generate_key - Generate a public and private key for signing and verifying messages between block verifiers

--synchronize_database_from_network_data_node - Synchronize the database from a network data node.

--synchronize_database_from_specific_delegate DELEGATES_IP_ADDRESS - Synchronize the database from a specific node, and does not check the majority. It will also exit the program once done syncing.
Note: This method of syncing is likely to be the most error prone, since it skips the majority checks, but will also likely be the fastest.
It should only be used in specific circumstances.

--disable_synchronizing_databases_and_starting_timers - Disables synchronizing the databases and starting the timers. Used for testing.

--test_data_add - Add test data to the databases

--test_data_remove - Remove test data from the databases
```


## Installation Options
XCASH_DPOPS provides a few different installation options. It is recommended to at least read over how to manually install XCASH_DPOPS, and then choose one of the installation options below:

[Manual Installation Process](#installation-process)  
[Automatic Installation Process](#auto-installation-process)  
[Docker Automatic Installation Process](#docker-automatic-installation-process)


## Installation Process

### Installation Path
It is recommend to install the XCASH_DPOPS folder, MongoDB and MongoDB C Driver in the home directory (`/home/$USER/`) or root directory (`/root/`) in a `x-network` folder

Create the `x-network` folder  
`mkdir ~/x-network/`

Create a `xcash_wallets` folder  
`mkdir ~/x-network/xcash_wallets`

Create a `logs` folder  
`mkdir ~/x-network/logs`



 
### Install System Packages
Make sure the systems packages list is up to date  
`sudo apt update`
 
Install the packages  
`sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git`
 
(Optionally) Install the packages for XCASH if you plan to [build XCASH from source](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/X-CASH#compiling-x-cash-from-source)
 
 
 
### Installing MongoDB From Binaries
 
Visit [https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
 
Then choose your OS, and make sure the version is the current version and the package is server. Then click on All version binaries. Now find the current version to download. You do not want the debug symbols or the rc version, just the regular current version.
 
Once you have downloaded the file move the file to a location where you want to keep the binaries, then run this set of commands 

**If you want to install MongoDB on a different hard drive then the hard drive your OS is installed on, make sure to change the path of the `/data/db`**
``` 
tar -xf mongodb-linux-x86_64-*.tgz
rm mongodb-linux-x86_64-*.tgz
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chmod 770 /data/db
sudo chown $USER /data/db
```

Then add MongoDB to your path  
`echo -e '\nexport PATH=MongoDB_folder:$PATH' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile
 
 
 
### Building the MongoDB C Driver From Source
 
Visit the official websites installation instructions at [http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html)
You will need to follow the instructions for [Building from a release tarball](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html#building-from-a-release-tarball) or [Building from git](http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/current/installing.html#building-from-git) since you need the header files, not just the library files.
 
After you have built the MongoDB C driver from source, you will need to run  
`sudo ldconfig`
 
 
 
### Cloning the Repository
```
cd ~/x-network 
git clone https://github.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_DPOPS.git
``` 
 
 
### Build Instructions
 
XCASH_DPOPS uses a Make file.
 
After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder  
`cd ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS`
 
Then use the make file to build the binary file  
`make clean ; make release -j $(nproc)`
 
 
 
## How To Setup and Install the Systemd Files

Edit the below systemd files to your paths

Copy all of the service files in the systemd folder to `/lib/systemd/system/`  
`cp -a ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/scripts/systemd/* /lib/systemd/system/`

Reload systemd  
`systemctl daemon-reload`

Create a systemd PID folder  
`mkdir ~/x-network/systemdpid/`

Create a logs folder  
`mkdir ~/x-network/logs/`

Create a mongod pid file and a xcashd pid file
```
touch ~/x-network/systemdpid/mongod.pid
touch ~/x-network/systemdpid/xcash_daemon.pid
```


### MongoDB
This is the systemd file for MongoDB
```
[Unit]
Description=MongoDB Database Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=root
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
PIDFile=/root/x-network/systemdpid/mongod.pid
ExecStart=/root/x-network/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1804-4.2.0/bin/mongod --fork --syslog

LimitFSIZE=infinity

LimitAS=infinity
LimitNOFILE=64000
LimitNPROC=64000
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
TasksMax=infinity
TasksAccounting=false

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You will need to change the **User** to the user of the system

You will need to change the **PIDFile** to the full path of the `mongod.pid` file

You will need to change the **ExecStart** to the full path of the `mongod` file

Reload systemd after you have made any changes to the systemd service files  
`systemctl daemon-reload`


### XCASH Daemon
This is the systemd file for XCASH Daemon
```
[Unit]
Description=XCASH Daemon systemd file
 
[Service]
Type=forking
User=root
PIDFile=/root/x-network/systemdpid/xcash_daemon.pid
ExecStart=/root/x-network/X-CASH/build/release/bin/xcashd --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 18281 --restricted-rpc --confirm-external-bind --log-file /root/x-network/logs/XCASH_Daemon_log.txt --max-log-file-size 0 --detach --pidfile /root/x-network/systemdpid/xcash_daemon.pid
RuntimeMaxSec=15d
Restart=always
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make sure to leave the RuntimeMaxSec in the systemd service file, as the XCASH Daemon usually needs to restart after a while to prevent it from not synchronizing

You will need to change the **User** to the user of the system

You will need to change the **PIDFile** to the full path of the `xcash_daemon.pid` file

You will need to change the **ExecStart** to the full path of the `xcashd` file

Reload systemd after you have made any changes to the systemd service files  
`systemctl daemon-reload`



### XCASH Wallet
This is the systemd file for XCASH Wallet
```
[Unit]
Description=XCASH Wallet
 
[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/root/x-network/X-CASH/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-rpc --wallet-file /root/x-network/xcash_wallets/WALLET_FILE_NAME --password PASSWORD --rpc-bind-port 18285 --confirm-external-bind --daemon-port 18281 --disable-rpc-login --trusted-daemon
Restart=always
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

You will need to change the **User** to the user of the system

You will need to change the **WALLET_FILE_NAME** with the name of your wallet file, and the **PASSWORD** with the password of your wallet file.

Reload systemd after you have made any changes to the systemd service files  
`systemctl daemon-reload`


### XCASH DPOPS
This is the systemd file for XCASH DPOPS
```
[Unit]
Description=XCASH DPOPS
 
[Service]
Type=simple
LimitNOFILE=64000
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/build/
ExecStart=/root/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/build/XCASH_DPOPS --block_verifiers_secret_key BLOCK_VERIFIERS_SECRET_KEY
Restart=always
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The LimitNOFILE will allow the XCASH DPOPS program to utilize up to 64000 concurrent file descriptors instead of the default 4096 for a linux process. The actual XCASH DPOPS program is limited to only accept up to 1000 concurrent connections due to that DPOPS usage and shared delegates website or delegates website usage will not be that much at the start. This will help with DDOS at this time and the limits in the XCASH DPOPS program will be updated.

You will need to change the **User** to the user of the system

You will need to change the **ExecStart** to the full path of the `XCASH_DPOPS` file and add any startup flags if running a shared delegates website or a delegates website

You will need to change the **BLOCK_VERIFIERS_SECRET_KEY** to your block verifiers secret key. Make sure this is the first parameter

For a full list of XCASH_DPOPS parameters please read the [XCASH_DPOPS Parameters](#xcash_dpops-parameters) section. This section will explain how to change any of the provided parameters in detail. Since the shared delegate option is probably the most used parameter, this parameter will be explained below.

```
--shared_delegates_website --fee "fee" --minimum_amount "minimum_amount" - Run the shared delegates website, with a fee of "fee" and a minimum amount of "minimum_amount"
The fee in a percentage (1 would equal 1 percent. You can use up to 6 decimal places.)
The minimum for a public_address to receive a payment (10000 etc. The minimum amount should be in regular units, not atomic units.)
```

Reload systemd after you have made any changes to the systemd service files  
`systemctl daemon-reload`



### Firewall
This is the systemd file for firewall
```
[Unit]
Description=firewall
 
[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
User=root
ExecStart=/root/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/scripts/firewall/firewall_script.sh
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You will need to change the **User** to the user of the system

You will need to change the **ExecStart** to the full path of the `firewall_script.sh` file

Reload systemd after you have made any changes to the systemd service files  
`systemctl daemon-reload`



## How To Setup the Firewall
 
We will need to setup a firewall for our DPOPS node. The goal of settings up the firewall is to block any DDOS attacks. We will use IPtables for the firewall
 
The firewall is configured for a solo node setup. To configure the firewall for a shared delegates website or delegates website:
 
Open the firewall script  
`nano ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/scripts/firewall/firewall_script.sh`
 
Uncomment these 3 lines (by removing the `#`) if running a shared delegates website or delegates website  
`# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 100 --connlimit-mask 32 -j DROP`
 
`# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT`
 
`# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 18283`
 
If you want to run the shared delegates website or delegates website using HTTPS, you will need to install a webserver like nginx and configure it.
 
Now we need to run the firewall script and activate it  
```
chmod +x ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/scripts/firewall/firewall_script.sh
~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/scripts/firewall/firewall_script.sh
iptables-save > /etc/network/iptables.up.rules
iptables-apply -t 60
```
 
You should then open another connection to the server to make sure it worked and did not lock you out. Then press y to confirm the changes for the firewall.

Now we need to enable the firewall systemd service file to run this script after a restart  
`systemctl enable firewall`
 
 
 
 
## How To Run Each Component
To start a systemd service  
`systemctl start name_of_service_file_without.service`

To stop a systemd service  
`systemctl stop name_of_service_file_without.service`

To restart a systemd service  
`systemctl restart name_of_service_file_without.service`

To check the status of a systemd service  
`systemctl status name_of_service_file_without.service`

For example

To start XCASH DPOPS service  
`systemctl start XCASH_DPOPS`

To stop XCASH DPOPS service  
`systemctl stop XCASH_DPOPS`

To restart XCASH DPOPS service  
`systemctl restart XCASH_DPOPS`

To check the status of XCASH DPOPS service  
`systemctl status XCASH_DPOPS`



## How To View Logs For Each Component
To view the logs for any service file. you can run  
`journalctl --unit=name_of_service_file_without.service`

To view only the last 100 lines of the log file, you can run  
`journalctl --unit=name_of_service_file_without.service -n 100 --output cat`

To view live logging of XCASH DPOPS, you can run  
`journalctl --unit=XCASH_DPOPS --follow -n 100 --output cat`

To view logs for the XCASH_Daemon systemd service  
`tail -f -n 100 ~/x-network/logs/XCASH_Daemon_log.txt`
 
 
 
## Running X-CASH Proof of stake test
It is recomeneded to run the X-CASH Proof of stake test before you run the main program. The test will ensure that your system is compatbile, and that you have setup your system correctly.
 
To run the X-CASH Proof of stake test, make sure to have already started the XCASH Daemon, XCASH Wallet and MongoDB systemd services, and to have stopped the XCASH DPOPS systemd service if it was already running. 

Navigate to the folder that contains the binary  
Rebuild the binary in debug mode  
`make clean ; make debug -j $(nproc)`

Then run the binary  
`./XCASH_DPOPS --block_verifiers_secret_key BLOCK_VERIFIER_SECRET_KEY --test`

Replace BLOCK_VERIFIER_SECRET_KEY with your block_verifiers_secret_key 
 
The test will return the number of passed and failed test on the bottom of the console. The failed test need to be 0 before you run the node. If the output is not showing 0 for failed test, then you need to scroll through the testing output and find what test failed (It will be red instead of green). If this is a system compatibility test, then you will need to fix the system. If this is a core test that has failed, then you need to possibly rebuild, or contact us with your OS version, and we can look into it.



## How to Use the XCASH DPOPS Wallet Commands



### How to Register a Delegate
Make sure to stop the XCASH_DPOPS service, if it is running  
`systemctl stop XCASH_DPOPS`

Generate a public and secret key pair for signing and verifying the block verifier messages, and for signing and verifying the blocks reserve bytes  
`~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/build/XCASH_DPOPS --generate_key`

Put the secret key in the `BLOCK_VERIFIERS_SECRET_KEY` in 
```
~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/src/global_data/block_verifiers_sign_and_verify_messages.h
```

Rebuild XCASH_DPOPS  
`make clean ; make debug -j $(nproc)`

Make sure that when updating the repository the `block_verifiers_sign_and_verify_messages.h` does not update  
```
git update-index --skip-worktree ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/src/global_data/block_verifiers_sign_and_verify_messages.h
```

You can always undo this change by running 
```  
git update-index --no-skip-worktree ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/src/global_data/block_verifiers_sign_and_verify_messages.h
```

Make sure to stop the XCASH Wallet service, if it is running  
`systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet`

Open the wallet file in the `xcash-wallet-cli`

Once the wallet is fully synchronized run the following:  
`delegate_register delegate_name delegate_IP_address block_verifier_messages_public_key`

Replace `delegate_name` with the name that you want to name your delegate

Replace `delegate_IP_address` with your VPS/dedicated servers IP Address or a domain name (View the setup below)

Replace `block_verifier_messages_public_key` with public key that you got from the `XCASH_DPOPS --generate_key`



### How to Vote For a Delegate
Make sure to stop the XCASH Wallet service if it is running  
`systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet`

Open the wallet file in the `xcash-wallet-cli`

Once the wallet is fully synchronized run the following:  
`vote delegates_public_address | delegates_name`

Replace `delegates_public_address | delegates_name` with the delegates public address or delegates name




### How to Update a Delegates Information
Make sure to stop the XCASH Wallet service if it is running  
`systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet`

Open the wallet file in the `xcash-wallet-cli`

Once the wallet is fully synchronized run the following:  
`delegate_update item value`

Replace `item` with the item you want to update. The list of valid items are:  

| Name                                         | Type          | Maximum Length or Range       |

### How to Remove a Delegate
Make sure to stop the XCASH Wallet service if it is running  
`systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet`

Open the wallet file in the `xcash-wallet-cli`

Once the wallet is fully synchronized run the following:  
`delegate_remove`

## How to Setup a Domain Name Instead of an IP Address
The XCASH DPOPS system needs a IP Address when registering a delegate to be able to let other delegates know where to send messages to. One can instead setup a domain name (**without the www.**) and register this instead of an IP address. The possible benefits of using a domain name over an IP address could be:

* One can change IP's from their domain page if they change servers instead of having to update that info in the DPOPS database.
* It would probably be more recognizable if there was a problem, since in the XCASH_DPOPS logs and the XCASH_Daemon logs it will print the source and destination of messages.

To Setup a domain instead of an IP address, go to the domain registrar you have purchased the domain name from. Add an A record to the domain. Each domain registrar is going to be a little different, so you will want to check if they have an official article on how to add an A record.

Now you need to setup the reverse DNS as well. Go to the hosting dashboard of the place where you are renting the server. Not all hosting companies let you change the reverse DNS, so you might not be able to change the reverse DNS. Navigate to the server your are renting. At this point their should be something that says modify the reverse DNS or something similar. Change it to the domain name you used in the first step.

At this point you can now register the domain name (**without the www.**) to the XCASH DPOPS system.



## Auto Installation Process
The XCASH DPOPS auto installer can be run to first setup the system, and then later in an update mode to update any needed x-network repositories or newer third party dependencies. It can also be run in a remove mode that will uninstall everything.

### Install
To Install, run the autoinstaller script, and choose Install at the menu.  
`scripts/autoinstaller/autoinstaller.sh`

Since the XCASH_DPOPS repository will probably not be downloaded yet onto your system, you can run directly from the github by running  
```
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_DPOPS/master/scripts/autoinstaller/autoinstaller.sh)"
```

You can then press enter for the default settings, or input custom settings. The autoinstaller will then install everything automatically for you.

The autoinstaller has the following customizable options:
```
Installation Directory
MongoDB Installation Directory
X-CASH Blockchain Installation Directory
Shared Delegate or Solo Delegate
Shared Delegate Fee
Shared Delegate Minimum Payment Amount
Create a New Wallet or Import an Existing Wallet
Generate a New Password or Use an Existing Password:
```


### Update

It is recommend to run the autoinstaller in update mode. The autoinstaller will update you automatically to the latest versions of:  
```
System Packages that are related X-CASH or XCASH_DPOPS
X-CASH
XCASH_DPOPS
XCASH_DPOPS_shared_delegates_website
MongoDB
Mongo C Driver
NodeJS
NPM
```


### Remove

The autoinstaller can also remove XCASH_DPOPS. It will remove the following items:
```
System Packages that are related X-CASH or XCASH_DPOPS
X-CASH
XCASH_DPOPS
XCASH_DPOPS_shared_delegates_website
MongoDB
Mongo C Driver
NodeJS
NPM
```



## Docker Automatic Installation Process
This will allow you to donwload a prebuilt docker image with the XCASH_DPOPS installed

It is recommended to install the firewall on your system (not inside the docker container)  
Follow the [How To Setup the Firewall](#how-to-setup-the-firewall)  part of the readme first.

### Install Docker  
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Download XCASH_DPOPS Docker Image
After this you will need to pull a [XCASH_DPOPS_image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xnetwork/xcash_dpops)  
`docker pull xnetwork/xcash_dpops:TAG`

[Supported tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/xnetwork/xcash_dpops/tags) use the following syntax:

PRODUCTIONTYPE_ LINUXDISTRO_LINUXDISTROVERSION

For example: mainnet_ubuntu_18.04  

Now list all of the images installed, and save the IMAGE_ID for the image you just downloaded  
`docker images`

### Create Docker Container

Now create a new container from the image you just downloaded 
```
docker run --name=XCASH_DPOPS -i -t -d --network host IMAGE_ID /bin/bash
```

From this point the docker container has been created and has already been started. If you need to start the container you can run  
`docker start XCASH_DPOPS`

and to stop the container run  


The docker container will remain running until stopped. You can enter and exit a container and it will still run unless stoped. At any time if you want enter the docker container you can run  
```
docker exec -e USER="root" -u root -t -i --privileged XCASH_DPOPS /bin/bash -c "source ~/.profile; /bin/bash"
```

To exit the container type  
`exit`

To stop the container run  
`docker stop XCASH_DPOPS`

To list all running containers run  
`docker ps -a`

To remove the container run  
`docker rm container XCASH_DPOPS`

### Configure the Container

Once you have a bash prompt inside of the container, you will need to either create a new wallet and block verifier key, or import them. To do this run the docker configuration script
```
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X-CASH-official/XCASH_DPOPS/master/scripts/autoinstaller/docker_configuration.sh)"
```

### Start and Stop Programs in the Container

Note: systemd is not enabled in docker containers. Instead the docker container uses screen with an auto restart script and log files

To start or stop the processes use the docker configuration script and run it in start programs or stop programs mode

You can also start or stop an individual process using screen (just replace the password and remove the shared delegate flags if you are going to run a solo node
```
screen -dmS MongoDB ~/x-network/mongodb-*/bin/mongod --logpath /root/x-network/logs/MongoDB_log.txt --logappend
screen -dmS XCASH_Daemon ~/x-network/X-CASH/build/release/bin/xcashd --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 18281 --restricted-rpc --confirm-external-bind --log-file /root/x-network/logs/XCASH_Daemon_log.txt --max-log-file-size 0
screen -dmS XCASH_Wallet ~/x-network/X-CASH/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-rpc --wallet-file /root/x-network/xcash_wallets/XCASH_DPOPS_WALLET --password WALLET_PASSWORD --rpc-bind-port 18285 --confirm-external-bind --daemon-port 18281 --disable-rpc-login --trusted-daemon
screen -dmS XCASH_DPOPS ~/x-network/XCASH_DPOPS/build/XCASH_DPOPS --log_file ~/x-network/logs/XCASH_DPOPS_log.txt --shared_delegates_website --fee DPOPS_FEE --minimum_amount DPOPS_MINIMUM_AMOUNT
```

To stop the following process using screen:
```
screen -XS "MongoDB" quit
screen -XS "XCASH_Daemon" quit
screen -XS "XCASH_Wallet" quit
screen -XS "XCASH_DPOPS" quit
```

### View Logs

To view the log files run the following commands  
MongoDB  
`tail -f -n 100 ~/x-network/logs/MongoDB_log.txt`

XCASH_Daemon  
`tail -f -n 100 ~/x-network/logs/XCASH_Daemon_log.txt`

XCASH_DPOPS  
`tail -f -n 100 ~/x-network/logs/XCASH_DPOPS_log.txt`


### Update the Container

To keep the system up to date use the docker configuration script and run it in update mode

You can also delete the container, **(Make sure to backup your wallet and block verifier key)** pull the latest docker version of the container, create a new container and import your wallet and block verifier key.



## How to Setup a Private Test
This will allow you to run your own private test setup of the DPOPS consensus for debugging purposes.

First, you will need at a minimum 4 servers or virtual machines. You can use any amount greater than or equal to 4, but its mandatory to use 4 to properly test the DBFT part of the consensus. It is recommended to use the autoinstaller to setup these 4 machines

Once you have the 4 machines setup, you will need a fully synced copy of the blockchain on each server.

Now you need to make the following code adjustments to work with your setup and to make a testnet copy of the official blockchain, this way you can mine blocks on it with your machines.

**X-CASH**

**src/p2p/net_node.h**  
Remove all seed nodes and add 2 of your servers IP addresses to `const std::vector<std::string> m_seed_nodes_list`

**src/p2p/net_node.inl**  
Remove all seed nodes and add 2 of your servers IP addresses to  
```
template<class t_payload_net_handler>
  std::set<std::string> node_server<t_payload_net_handler>::get_seed_nodes(cryptonote::network_type nettype) const
  {
    std::set<std::string> full_addrs;
    if (nettype == cryptonote::TESTNET)
    {
      full_addrs.insert("testnetseed1.x-cash.org:28280");
      full_addrs.insert("testnetseed2.x-cash.org:28280");
    }
    else if (nettype == cryptonote::STAGENET)
    {
    }
    else if (nettype == cryptonote::FAKECHAIN)
    {
    }
    else
    {
      full_addrs.insert("delegates.xcash.foundation:18280");
      full_addrs.insert("europe1.xcash.foundation:18280");
      full_addrs.insert("europe2.xcash.foundation:18280");
      full_addrs.insert("europe3.xcash.foundation:18280");
      full_addrs.insert("asia1.xcash.foundation:18280");
    }
    return full_addrs;
  }
```

**src/cryptonote_config.h**  
Change the block height to the current block height of your blockchain
`#define HF_BLOCK_HEIGHT_PROOF_OF_STAKE 449850 // The first block of the X-CASH proof of stake`

Change these to the total amount of servers you will use and how much percentage for verifying a block you will want
```
// XCASH DPOPS
#define BLOCK_VERIFIERS_AMOUNT 100 // The amount of block verifiers in a round
#define BLOCK_VERIFIERS_VALID_AMOUNT 67 // The amount of block verifiers that need to vote true for the part of the round to be valid.
#define BLOCK_VERIFIERS_VALID_AMOUNT_PERCENTAGE 0.67 // The amount of block verifiers in a percentage that need to vote true for the part of the round to be valid.
```

Change these define macros to your setup. Change the NETWORK_DATA_NODES_AMOUNT to the amount of seed nodes in the previous step. Remove or add NETWORK_DATA_NODE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_N depending on how many seed nodes you have, and list there public address and IP address

```

Now you can disable the reserve proofs checker since there is no penalties in a test setup and this will also allow you to not have to register, or vote for the delegates. Comment out the following lines of code

**src/XCASH_DPOPS.c**

```
  // start the check_reserve_proofs_timer_thread
  if (pthread_create(&thread_id[1], NULL, &check_reserve_proofs_timer_thread, NULL) != 0 && pthread_detach(thread_id[1]) != 0)
  {
    MAIN_ERROR("Could not start the check_reserve_proofs_timer_thread");
  }

  color_print("Started the check reserve proofs timer thread","green");
```

At this point you can run the test setup. Make sure to run the main server (NETWORK_DATA_NODE_1_PUBLIC_ADDRESS) first, then run all of the other network data nodes. Once those are done syncing run all other servers. 

Start all of the servers right after 0 seconds of a divisible by 5 minute (0,5,10 etc) this way the block creation process will start at the next divisible by 5 minute and will give your nodes enough time to sync and start up (although this usually only takes a minute)

Also make sure you run xcashd with the `--block-verifier` flag

If your computer system does not have internet access, make sure to run the xcashd on the NETWORK_DATA_NODE_1 system with `./xcashd --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 18281 --confirm-external-bind --restricted-rpc --block-verifier` andd run the other systems with `./xcashd --allow-local-ip --add-exclusive-node IP_OF_MAIN_SERVER --block-verifier`



## How to Debug the Code on a Server
If your looking to participate in the bug bounty, having the ability to debug the code while it is running on the server will be essential. In this part, we will explain how to use visual studio code and gdb to visually debug the program on your desktop.

**Note this works best on a Linux host machine, although there are ways to get it to work with MacOS and Windows**

#### Note It is strongly recommended to run this on a Linux host inside of a virtual machine. This is due to the fact that X11 forwarding can allow someone on the server to run X11 programs on your machine, or to collect data on your currently running programs.


### Allow X11 Forwarding on the server
First, we need to make sure that SSH is setup to allow X11 forwarding. Open the SSH config file on the server  
`nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config`

Add the following line at the bottom of the file  
`ForwardX11 yes`

Restart the ssh service  
`systemctl restart sshd.service`



### Install GDB and vscode
Install gdb on the server  
`sudo apt install gdb`

Install X11 dependencies  
`sudo apt install xauth libx11-xcb1 libasound2 x11-apps libice6 libsm6 libxaw7 libxft2 libxmu6 libxpm4 libxt6 x11-apps xbitmaps libxtst6`

Install vscode on the server
```
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
add-apt-repository -y "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
apt update -y
apt install -y code
```

[Install the C++/C extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
`code --install-extension ms-vscode.cpptools`

### Run vscode on the Server and Forward the GUI to a Dekstop

Add `-XC -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com` to the front of any ssh command that you would normally use to connect to the server.

Optionally try `-X -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com` to run without compression. On fast Internet connections no compression might be faster.

Once connected type `code` to start vscode. If root you might have to run `code --user-data-dir PATH_TO_FOLDER` to get it to run. Make sure its an empty folder only used for vscode

It might take 10-30 seconds for the vscode window to appear on your dekstop.

You can now use vscode on your dekstop but it will have the file system of the server. It will be a little laggy though, so its probably not good for writing new functions, but for quick file edits (since you have the files panel) and for debugging it should work fine.

### Change vscode Keyboard Shortcuts
Optionally change the vscode keyboard shortcuts to the following

Open the keyboard shortcuts  
`File=>Prederences=>Keyboard Shortcuts

At the search bar at the top type `saveall`. For the `File: Save All` edit it to `Control+S` and ignore the warning about there already being that keyboard shortcut

At the search bar at the top type `start debugging`. For the `Debug: Start Debugging` edit it to `Control+Shift+D` and ignore the warning about there already being that keyboard shortcut

This will now allow you to save all files with `Control+S`

To rebuild, and start the debugger use `Control+Shift+D`

If the keyboard shortcuts are not changed, then to rebuild and start the debugger it is `F5` and `Control+Shift+D` to switch to the debugger panel

The vscode files have already been written for you and are included in the `.vscode` directory
